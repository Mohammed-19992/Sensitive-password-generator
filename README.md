This application is so interesting in many ways. In addition to a lot of things i learnt while doing this project, I finally realize I can build a cpmplete project with many functions based on given criterias. 

This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface as well as being responsive. It also adapts to multiple screen sizes using the viewpoet code in the html file.

The app allows users to get as many complicated passwords as they want to use in protecting sensitive data, such as banks and security companies.

Once the user opens the page of the app and clicks on Generate Password botton (using an addEventListener), a series of pop-up windows appear asking for specifing the criteria the user wants to include in the password. The windows ask the uder to choose the length of the password and the type of the characters they want to include in their password. If user does not select any of the character types in these windows, the user is asked to try again and to inlcude at least one type of characters.
